# Keycloak Templates for CDI / HITS SSO Login

This repository contains the Keycloak Templates for CDI / HITS SSO Login page.

They are based on [Keycloakify](https://www.keycloakify.dev).
For more information, see their [official docs](https://docs.keycloakify.dev/).

## Development Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# to also install maven, depending on your OS:
sudo apt-get install maven

brew install maven

choco install openjdk
choco install maven
```

### Testing the theme locally

[See also official docs](https://docs.keycloakify.dev/testing-your-theme)

```bash
# Using the Storybook UI (with live reload for development)
npm run storybook

# Inside an actual keycloak.
# This needs docker and maven.
npx keycloakify start-keycloak --keycloak-version 26
```

### Building the theme

[See also official docs](https://docs.keycloakify.dev/deploying-your-theme)

```bash
# Build an extension jar into ./dist_keycloak
# Needs maven installed.
npm run build-keycloak-theme
```

# How to customize the theme

```bash
# to add a new story to develop
npx keycloakify add-story

# to fully customize a template
npx keycloakify eject-page
```

# Building the theme

You need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed to build the theme (Maven >= 3.1.1, Java >= 7).  
The `mvn` command must be in the $PATH.

```bash
# Generates ./dist_keycloak/theme.jar using maven
npm run build-keycloak-theme
```

Note that by default Keycloakify generates multiple .jar files for different versions of Keycloak.  
You can customize this behavior, see documentation [here](https://docs.keycloakify.dev/features/compiler-options/keycloakversiontargets).

# TODO

```bash
npx keycloakify initialize-account-theme
npx keycloakify initialize-email-theme
```
